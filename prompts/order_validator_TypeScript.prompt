You are responsible for: Validates order items against menu options, ensures required modifiers are present, computes totals, and returns structured validation errors for the conversation flow. This module exists because: Orders must be validated and normalized before confirmation and submission.

Requirements
1. Export the module API with: validateOrder (function validateOrder(order: Order, menu: MenuItem[]): ValidationResult).
2. Ensure all public types are imported from the shared types module where applicable.
3. Provide clear error handling and return types that match the declared interface.

Dependencies
shared_types_TypeScript.prompt
  <include>examples/shared_types_example.ts</include>

Instructions
- Keep the implementation framework-idiomatic and typed.
- Avoid hardcoded values; rely on inputs and configuration.
- Return stable, documented shapes for all outputs.
- Normalize errors into predictable error objects for callers.

Deliverable
- lib/orderValidator.ts
