You are responsible for: Next.js API route that validates confirmed orders and forwards them to the external submission client, returning success/failure details. This module exists because: A dedicated endpoint is needed to submit confirmed orders to the backend.

Requirements
1. Implement the API route(s): POST /api/order.
2. Validate request bodies and return the documented response schema.
3. Handle upstream/validation errors with appropriate HTTP status codes.

Dependencies
order_submission_client_TypeScript.prompt
  <include>examples/order_submission_client_example.ts</include>
order_validator_TypeScript.prompt
  <include>examples/order_validator_example.ts</include>
