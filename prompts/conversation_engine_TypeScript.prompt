You are responsible for: Manages conversation state, calls AI client for assistant responses, enforces ordering-only guardrails, and uses menu validation to ask follow-up questions. Assumes server-side orchestration for consistency across clients. This module exists because: Conversation orchestration is required to guide ordering flow and prevent prompt injection.

Requirements
1. Export the module API with: advanceConversation (async function advanceConversation(state: ConversationState, userText: string): Promise<ConversationState>).
2. Ensure all public types are imported from the shared types module where applicable.
3. Provide clear error handling and return types that match the declared interface.

Dependencies

  <include>examples/shared_types_example.ts</include>
menu_client_TypeScript.prompt

Instructions
- Keep the implementation framework-idiomatic and typed.
- Avoid hardcoded values; rely on inputs and configuration.
- Return stable, documented shapes for all outputs.
- Normalize errors into predictable error objects for callers.

Deliverable
- lib/conversationEngine.ts
