You are responsible for: Client for submitting confirmed orders to an external kitchen or POS API. Handles retries for transient failures and normalizes error responses. This module exists because: Order submission must be encapsulated to isolate third-party integration details.

Requirements
1. Export the module API with: submitOrder (async function submitOrder(order: Order): Promise<SubmissionResult>).
2. Ensure all public types are imported from the shared types module where applicable.
3. Provide clear error handling and return types that match the declared interface.

Dependencies
shared_types_TypeScript.prompt
  <include>examples/shared_types_example.ts</include>
env_config_TypeScript.prompt
  <include>examples/env_config_example.ts</include>

Instructions
- Keep the implementation framework-idiomatic and typed.
- Avoid hardcoded values; rely on inputs and configuration.
- Return stable, documented shapes for all outputs.
- Normalize errors into predictable error objects for callers.

Deliverable
- lib/orderSubmissionClient.ts
