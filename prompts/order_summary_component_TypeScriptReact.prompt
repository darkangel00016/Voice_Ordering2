You are responsible for: Client component that displays the current order items, modifiers, totals, and validation errors with clear confirm/cancel actions. This module exists because: Order summary UI is required to confirm items, modifiers, and totals before submission.

Requirements
1. Accept props: order: Order, validation: ValidationResult (optional).
2. Emit events: confirm, edit.
3. Provide clear user feedback states and preserve accessibility.

Dependencies
shared_types_TypeScript.prompt
  <include>examples/shared_types_example.ts</include>

Instructions
- Keep the component focused on presentation + events; state is owned by the parent unless required.
- Gracefully handle missing browser capabilities (speech, mic, etc.).

Deliverable
- components/OrderSummary.tsx
