You are responsible for: Client for fetching menu data from an external API (mocked initially) with basic caching and error normalization. Assumes HTTP-based menu provider. This module exists because: Menu retrieval must be abstracted so the UI and conversation logic can validate items against the current menu.

Requirements
1. Export the module API with: fetchMenu (async function fetchMenu(): Promise<MenuItem[]>).
2. Ensure all public types are imported from the shared types module where applicable.
3. Provide clear error handling and return types that match the declared interface.

Dependencies
shared_types_TypeScript.prompt
  <include>examples/shared_types_example.ts</include>
env_config_TypeScript.prompt
  <include>examples/env_config_example.ts</include>

Instructions
- Keep the implementation framework-idiomatic and typed.
- Avoid hardcoded values; rely on inputs and configuration.
- Return stable, documented shapes for all outputs.
- Normalize errors into predictable error objects for callers.

Deliverable
- lib/menuClient.ts
