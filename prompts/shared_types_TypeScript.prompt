You are responsible for: Defines core TypeScript types such as MenuItem, ModifierOption, OrderItem, Order, ConversationTurn, and API request/response shapes. Assumes a TypeScript-based codebase since no tech stack file is provided. This module exists because: Shared domain types are needed to keep menu, order, and conversation data consistent across frontend and API routes.

Requirements
1. Export the module API with: MenuItem (interface MenuItem), Order (interface Order).
2. Ensure all public types are imported from the shared types module where applicable.
3. Provide clear error handling and return types that match the declared interface.

Dependencies
- None

Instructions
- Keep the implementation framework-idiomatic and typed.
- Avoid hardcoded values; rely on inputs and configuration.
- Return stable, documented shapes for all outputs.
- Normalize errors into predictable error objects for callers.

Deliverable
- lib/types.ts
