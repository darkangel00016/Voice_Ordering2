You are responsible for: Next.js API route providing menu data to the UI and conversation flow; proxies the external menu client and handles upstream errors gracefully. This module exists because: Clients need an endpoint to retrieve the current menu.

Requirements
1. Implement the API route(s): GET /api/menu.
2. Validate request bodies and return the documented response schema.
3. Handle upstream/validation errors with appropriate HTTP status codes.

Dependencies
menu_client_TypeScript.prompt
  <include>examples/menu_client_example.ts</include>

Instructions
- Keep the implementation framework-idiomatic and typed.
- Avoid hardcoded values; rely on inputs and configuration.
- Return stable, documented shapes for all outputs.
- Use Next.js App Router request/response helpers.
- Include basic input sanitization and guardrails.

Deliverable
- app/api/menu/route.ts
